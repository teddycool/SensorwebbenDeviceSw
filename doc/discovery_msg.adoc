# The discovery message for Homeassistant

This is the pattern for the config-msg sent to Homeassistant at sensor set-up. It is sent with the retain-flag set to true so it will be stored in the mqtt-broker and sent to Homeassistant at start-up.

The sensor sends the message to the following topic: 

homeassistant/sensor/<devid>/sw_<devid>-<dclass>/config

with the following format and content for each 'sensor' entity:


[source,json]
----
{
    "name": "<devid>-<dclass>",
    "state_topic": "home/sensor/sw_<devid>",
    "unit_of_measurement": "<unit>",
    "device_class": "<dclass>",
    "value_template": "{{ value_json.<dclass> }}",
    "unique_id": "sw_<devid>-<dclass>",
    "device": {
        "identifiers": [
            "sw_<devid>"
        ],
        "manufacturer": "www.sensorwebben.se",
        "model": "Sensor Model <name>",
        "sw_version": "2.2.1"
    }
}
