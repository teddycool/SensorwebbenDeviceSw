# The sensor-device software

## Version 2.2.x
 * Completely rewritten and only local configuration via the ap web-gui
 * The connection to sensorwebben.se is completely removed
 * Currently only works with mqtt

## Purpose

This project contains the software for a sensor-device built around ESP8266 using a DHT11 or DHT22.

Pre-built hardware is sold by www.sensorwebben.se but the circuit-diagram is included in this project for reference.

The pre-built hardware also has connection for I2C and any I2C-sensor can by used if the software is updated with support.

The pre-built hardware also have optional support for a Dallas one-wire, replacing the DHTx. Other hardware that can be added on the pcb is a HSM-circuit connected via I2C and also a LiPo-charger and a connector for use with rechargeble LiPo batteries instead of 3xAAA.

### Pre-requisites for using the sensor-device

WiFi coverage and an MQTT server that recieves the data. It is built and prepared for Home Assistant but will probably work for other systems as well but configuration out-of-the-box is now only supported for Home Assistant even if some topics can be changed in the parameters.

#### Pre-requisites for Home Assistant
Before setting-up and using the sensors you need to have a working Home Assistant installation. In addition to this you need to install an MQTT server and configure it in Home Assistant. Mosquitto is a good choice for the MQTT server.

For more details on Home Assistant, visit: link:https://www.home-assistant.io/[Home Assistant]


### The sensor-device's way of working
There are 2 different 'modes' controlled by the switch on the PCB.

#### 1: Configuration mode (switch away from the batteries)
In this mode the sensor-device creates an accesspoint and starts a webserver where you can configure the wifi to use and also other parameters like your mqtt-server, topics and measuring interval.

When the sensor connects to the wifi after a successful configuration it will send configuration messages directed to Home Assistant that will automatically set up one 'device' with one 'sensor' for each of the entities sent from the sensor-device.

For more details, see the discovery message documentation: link:discovery_msg.adoc[Discovery Message]

#### 2: STD mode (switch towards the batteries)
In this mode the sensor connects to the configured wifi and mqtt-server and starts meassuring in cycles with the deep-sleep period defined by the parameter in-between.

For more details, see the publish message documentation: link:publish_msg.adoc[Publish Message]

##### Error indication (in std-mode)

If the red led blinks a couple of times in STD mode, something is wrong.

* 2 blink: the wifi-connection failed. Check your wifi-settings
* 3 blink: the mqtt-connection failed. Check your mqtt-settings 
* 4 or more: some internal error. Check the serial output for more info.

### The development environment
I use Visual Studio Code with PlatformIO extension but any Arduino type of enviroment should work.

### The hardware, programming inteface
