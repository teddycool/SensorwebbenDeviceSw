= Misto - Environmental Sensor Device

The Misto is a compact, battery-powered environmental monitoring device designed for indoor use. Built around the ESP8266 microcontroller, it provides wireless connectivity operation for home automation and environmental monitoring applications.

All open-source, hardware and software designs are available in this repository for building your own Misto devices or get inspired for other projects.

== Overview

Misto is a versatile sensor platform that measures temperature, humidity, and monitors its own battery status. The device is designed for integration with Home Assistant and other IoT platforms through MQTT communication, making it ideal for smart home deployments.

== Misto Programming Interface
Misto has a 5-pin programming interface with this pinout (left to right)

1. **+3V3**: Use only without batteries installed.
2. **GND**: Connect to the programmer's GND pin.
3. **>TX**: Connect to the programmer's TX pin.
4. **>RX**: Connect to the programmer's RX pin.
5. **PGM**: Connect to GND at power-on or RESET for programming mode before flashing firmware.

== References and Design Files

This section provides links to the hardware design files and documentation for the Misto environmental sensor device.
Unfurthunatly Misto was designed before I started to use KiCad for all my hardware designs. There will soon be a new version of Misto designed in KiCad and that design will be open-sourced.
