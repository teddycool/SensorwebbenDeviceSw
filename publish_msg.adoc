# The publish message for Homeassistant

This is the pattern for the publish-message sent to Homeassistant at every measuring cycle.

The sensor sends the message to the Homeassistant mqtt-broker to the following topic: 

home/sensor/sw_<devid>

with the following format and value-content for each 'sensor' entity. Note that localip 
and ssid not is a part of the configuration and will not show up as 'sensors' in Homeassistant.
